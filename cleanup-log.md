# Mirgos Project Cleanup and Import Fixing Log
Date: 06/10/2025 02:37:38

## Updates Made
- Updated imports from 'GameContext' to 'GameContext-refactored' in 11 files

## Files Deleted
- fe\src\context\GameContext-fixed.jsx - fe\src\context\GameContext-enhanced.jsx - fe\src\context\GameContext.jsx - fe\src\pages\GameHUDNew.jsx - fe\src\pages\GameHUDWrapper.jsx - fe\src\pages\GameHUDWrapper2.jsx - fe\src\utils\connectionDiagnostics.js - fe\src\utils\socketHooks.js - fe\src\utils\lobby.js

All files were backed up to: C:\Users\Bemga\OneDrive - ITM STEP MMC\Desktop\mirgos\backup-20250610-023738

## Reason for Updates and Deletion
1. Updated imports to use the refactored GameContext that's used by the main application flow
2. Deleted unnecessary files:
   - GameContext variants: Only GameContext-refactored.jsx is now being used in the application
   - GameHUD variants: Only GameHUD.jsx and GameHUDRefactored.jsx are actively used
   - Empty utility files: These files were empty and unused
   - Duplicate lobby files: lobby-refactored.js is the version being used throughout the application
